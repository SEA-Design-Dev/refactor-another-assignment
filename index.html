            <h3>Nicola</h3>
            <p>Imagine a french opera singer strutting her stuff along Parisian boulevards. That&rsquo;s Nicola. She sets the trends but can&rsquo;t be bothered with what others are up to. Until she has something to share, that is. Those lungs aren&rsquo;t just for the stage.</p>

          <h3>Betty</h3>
          <p>Sometimes chided for being gullible, Betty is the most trusting of our alpaca trio.  She has a gentle touch and is friendly toward visiting dogs, cats, and humans.  Betty would love to meet you and take a treat from your hand.</p>

            <h3>Domino</h3>
            <p>Like the first domino in a row, this lady will knock you down if you get in her way.  She&rsquo;s quick on her feet and will make you work if you want to get close.  Domino has a good poker face and, if you&rsquo;re not careful, she might get you with her superb spitting technique.</p>
