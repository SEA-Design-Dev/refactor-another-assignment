+### A project for Code Fellows B25 by Loann Lam and Shane Kalles.
+
+Refactor a team's project.
+
+We refactored Levi and Galen's CSS project. We found many redundant naming schemes within the main element. Most were to style each article rather than think of each as modular. We continued to use the column choice that they had made.
+
+We were able to remove a bit of CSS code from the main and normalizer files. and found that we could remove extra class names and refer to the element tags and make our style choices to the children or classes from there.
